  "faq": "FAQ",
  "faqQuestion1": "Why does my video merging take too long?",
  "faqAnswer1": "When video specs are different from each other, re-encoding is applied to ensure that the output video will work on every video player without any problems. This process may take a bit longer based on the video length and the CPU capability of your device.",
  "faqQuestion2": "Can I merge videos without re-encoding?",
  "faqAnswer2": "If the video specs are identical, the app can merge them without re-encoding, saving time and preserving quality.",
  "faqQuestion3": "How do I add videos for merging?",
  "faqAnswer3": "Tap the \"Video\" option on the navigation bar to open the video picker, then select up to four videos.",
  "faqQuestion4": "How many videos can I merge at the same time?",
  "faqAnswer4": "You can merge up to four videos at a time.",
  "faqQuestion5": "How can I order the videos for merging?",
  "faqAnswer5": "Select the videos in the order you want them merged when using the video picker.",
  "faqQuestion6": "Can I change the order of the videos before merging?",
  "faqAnswer6": "No, you must select the videos in the desired order when using the video picker.",
  "faqQuestion7": "How do I delete a video from the merge list?",
  "faqAnswer7": "It is not possible to edit merge list after selection, to modify the list you should tap videos on the navigation bar to open video picker and recreate the list.",
  "faqQuestion8": "How do I save the merged video?",
  "faqAnswer8": "After tapping the save button, the videos will be merged and automatically saved to your gallery.",
  "faqQuestion9": "Can I preview the merged video before saving?",
  "faqAnswer9": "Yes, the video in the merge section serves as a preview of the final output.",
  "faqQuestion10": "How do I export the merged video to social media?",
  "faqAnswer10": "After merging, the output video will be automatically saved to your gallery. From there, you can directly upload it to your social media accounts.",
  "faqQuestion11": "Can I trim videos before merging them?",
  "faqAnswer11": "Yes and no. You can use our other app, VClip, to trim videos by selecting the start and end points. This way, you can trim each video before merging them in this app.",
  "faqQuestion12": "How do I adjust the output video resolution?",
  "faqAnswer12": "Go to the settings menu and select the desired resolution for the output video before starting the merge process.",
  "faqQuestion13": "Can I merge videos of different resolutions?",
  "faqAnswer13": "Yes, you can merge videos of different resolutions. The app will adjust them to the resolution as set in the settings.",
  "faqQuestion14": "Can I merge videos with different aspect ratios?",
  "faqAnswer14": "Yes, the app will adjust the aspect ratios based on the configuration that is set.",
  "faqQuestion15": "Can I merge videos with different frame rates?",
  "faqAnswer15": "Yes, the app can handle videos with different frame rates and will adjust them during the merging process.",
  "faqQuestion16": "Can I merge videos with different codecs?",
  "faqAnswer16": "Yes, the app supports multiple codecs and will re-encode as necessary to ensure compatibility.",
  "faqQuestion17": "Can I merge videos with different audio formats?",
  "faqAnswer17": "Yes, the app will standardize the audio formats during the merging process.",
  "faqQuestion18": "Can I merge videos without audio?",
  "faqAnswer18": "Yes, you can mute the audio tracks before merging if you prefer a silent video. To do this, open the settings menu and set the sound option to off.",
  "faqQuestion19": "Can I merge videos with subtitles?",
  "faqAnswer19": "Yes, the app supports merging videos with embedded subtitles. However, external subtitle files are not supported at this time.",
  "faqQuestion20": "Does the app support 4K videos?",
  "faqAnswer20": "Yes, the app supports 4K video merging, provided your device has the necessary resources to handle high-resolution files.",
  "faqQuestion21": "What is the maximum file size supported for merging?",
  "faqAnswer21": "The app can handle large files, but the maximum supported size depends on your device’s capabilities.",
  "faqQuestion22": "What do I do if the app is running slowly?",
  "faqAnswer22": "Close other applications to free up system resources, and check for any available updates for the app.",
  "faqQuestion23": "Why is my device overheating during the merge process?",
  "faqAnswer23": "Video merging is resource-intensive and may cause your device to heat up. Ensure your device has proper ventilation and consider merging fewer videos at a time.",
  "faqQuestion24": "Why does the app crash during merging?",
  "faqAnswer24": "This is likely due to a memory-related issue that can occur on devices with low memory.",
  "faqQuestion25": "What should I do if the app crashes during merging?",
  "faqAnswer25": "Ensure you have sufficient free space. Restart the app and try with fewer videos. If the problem persists, contact support.",
  "faqQuestion26": "Why does the merged video file size seem large?",
  "faqAnswer26": "The file size depends on the resolution, bitrate, and length of the merged video.",
  "faqQuestion27": "Why is the video quality reduced after merging?",
  "faqAnswer27": "Ensure you are using the highest quality settings. Some loss of quality may occur due to compression and encoding.",
  "faqQuestion28": "What should I do if the merged video has no sound?",
  "faqAnswer28": "Check the sound settings and ensure that the source videos have working audio tracks.",
  "faqQuestion29": "Is there a way to automatically sync audio and video?",
  "faqAnswer29": "The app includes an automatic sync feature that aligns audio and video tracks during the merging process.",
  "faqQuestion30": "Why does the app require access to my media files?",
  "faqAnswer30": "The app needs access to your media files to select, process, and save videos during the merge process.",
  "faqQuestion31": "How do I change the theme of the app?",
  "faqAnswer31": "Go to the theme menu and select your preferred theme from the available options.",
